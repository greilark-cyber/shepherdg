# Hi, I'm Shepherd Griffin 👋
### Senior Technical Marketing Engineer | Solutions Architect | Systems Optimizer

I’m a **Technical Translator** who thrives in the "gray space" between hardware-level performance and enterprise-scale operations. I specialize in taking complex engineering hurdles and turning them into scalable **Solution Blueprints** and high-fidelity technical content.

## 🛠 What I’m Building
* **Demo Engineering:** Architecting high-concurrency production environments optimized for **NVIDIA NVENC** hardware acceleration.

* **Observability:** Leveraging **Splunk (SPL)** and telemetry to maintain an 80% success rate in definitive root-cause identification.

## 🚀 The TME Mindset
I believe that the best technical products deserve the best technical stories. Whether I'm deep-diving into kernel-level security or documenting a hybrid-cloud reference architecture, my goal is to drive adoption through **clarity, care, and hands-on validation.**
